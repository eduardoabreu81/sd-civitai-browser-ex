## 🔢 Ex Versioning

Ex uses semantic versioning with this format:

- `vX.Y.Z-ex` (forked from Neo `vX.Y.Z`)
- `X` = Major updates (breaking changes or major architecture shifts)
- `Y` = Minor updates (new features and UX improvements)
- `Z` = Bug fixes, regressions, and stability patches
- `-ex` suffix marks releases exclusive to the Ex line

Examples:
- `v0.6.3-ex`: First Ex release — Neo v0.6.3 features for A1111 and Forge Classic
- `v0.6.4-ex`: Ex-specific bug fix on top of the v0.6.3 base
- `v0.7.0-ex`: New feature set, backward-compatible

---

## 🆕 What's New — v0.2.x-ex

### Wildcard Download Improvements *(synced from Neo)*

- **Wildcards get their own subfolder** — each wildcard pack downloads into `wildcards/<model-name>/` by default, compatible with sd-dynamic-prompts `__subfolder/name__` syntax
- **No preview images for wildcards** — `save_preview` and `save_images` are skipped for Wildcards
- **Configurable base-model split for wildcards** — new setting `Organize wildcards by base model` (off by default)

## 🆕 What's New — v0.2.0-ex

> **Stability & Feature Sync** — all Neo v0.7.0 fixes and improvements, now on A1111 and Forge Classic.

- **☑️ Update Selected** — in Update Mode, check any subset of outdated cards and click "Update Selected (N)" to queue only those; button reverts to "Update All" when nothing is selected
- **🎯 Smart version selection** — clicking a card with an active base model filter (e.g. Illustrious) auto-selects the most recent version for that family
- **🔒 Downloads survive screen lock** — Win+L, RunPod reconnects, and SSE disconnects no longer abort downloads in progress
- **🛡️ EARLY_ACCESS / NO_API safety** — API-blocked downloads no longer save partial `.json`/`.html` files or delete unrelated existing files
- **📁 Embeddings folder auto-detection** — supports both old (`embeddings/`) and new (`models/embeddings/`) layouts; warns if both have files
- **🖼️ Fixed send-to-txt2img** — intermittent failure sending prompt/settings to txt2img resolved
- **🐛 Session restore guard** — download queue no longer crashes restoring a session when the model list hasn't loaded yet
- **🐛 Model info crash fix** — model info panel no longer errors on lazy fetch when queue enriches a model not in current search results
- **🐛 `save_images` guard** — no crash when preview HTML is unavailable for a model
- **🐛 Debug log format** — debug messages now use the correct `[CivitAI Browser Ex]` prefix and respect the debug setting

- **Audit log** — `ex_update_audit.jsonl` records every scan and retention action for traceability
- **Dashboard update summary** — after scanning, the Dashboard shows a live banner with outdated counts per type

### 🗂️ Auto-Organization

- **Organize new downloads automatically** into subfolders by base model type (SDXL/, Pony/, Illustrious/, etc.)
- **Organize existing models** in one click from the Update Models tab
- **Validate organization** — read-only scan that checks every model against its `.json` metadata and reports ✅ correct / ❌ misplaced / ⚠️ no-metadata, with a per-file table
- **Fix misplaced files** — after validation, move only the flagged models to their correct subfolders in one click; backup created automatically
- **Backup before organizing** — automatic snapshot of current folder structure
- **One-click rollback** — restore previous structure at any time (keeps last 5 backups)
- **Custom category patterns** — define your own base model → folder mapping in Settings (JSON)

### 🖼️ Model Info & Preview

- **Model information panel** — shows name, version, base model, type, trained tags, permissions, description
- **Sample images** with a **"Send to txt2img"** button per image — fills prompt, negative, sampler, steps, CFG all at once
- **Individual meta field buttons** — click any field (Prompt, Negative, Seed, CFG...) to send just that value to txt2img. **Shift+click appends** to your existing prompt instead of replacing
- **Trained tags / trigger words** — displayed in the model info panel and in the **model overlay popup** (CivitAI icon on txt2img/img2img cards). The **"➕ Add to prompt" button** appends activation tags directly to your txt2img prompt; for **LORA models it automatically prepends `<lora:filename:1>`**
- **SHA256 in Version Information** — the model info overlay shows the SHA256 hash of the selected file; click once to select all for easy copy
- **Video preview** support — model cards with video samples play on hover (muted, loops automatically)
- **Image viewer** — click any preview image to open it fullscreen
- **Resize preview images** in cards — configurable max resolution (128–1024px) for faster loading
- **Save model info** — saves model data as `.json` and HTML with all sample images
- **Save images** — downloads all sample images locally
- **Use local HTML** — when clicking the CivitAI button on a model card in txt2img, open the locally saved HTML instead of fetching from the internet

### 📊 Dashboard & Statistics

- **Disk usage by category** — see exactly how much space each model type and architecture uses

## 📁 Auto-Organization System

### How It Works

The organization system analyzes your models based on their `baseModel` metadata (stored in `.json` files) and automatically organizes them into subfolders.

#### **Before Organization:**
```
models/Lora/
├── model1.safetensors (SDXL)
├── model2.safetensors (Pony)
├── model3.safetensors (Illustrious)
├── random_folder/
│   └── model4.safetensors (SD1.5)
└── ...
```

#### **After Organization:**
```
models/Lora/
├── SDXL/
│   ├── model1.safetensors
│   ├── model1.json
│   └── model1.png
├── Pony/
│   └── model2.safetensors
├── Illustrious/
│   └── model3.safetensors
├── SD/
│   └── model4.safetensors
└── ...
```

### Safety Features

- ✅ **Automatic Backup**: Creates backup before any operation
- ✅ **One-Click Undo**: Restore original structure anytime
- ✅ **Associated Files**: Moves `.json`, `.png`, `.txt` files together
- ✅ **Conflict Detection**: Skips files that already exist at destination
- ✅ **Error Recovery**: Continues operation even if some files fail

## 📊 Dashboard & Statistics

### Overview

The Dashboard provides comprehensive insight into your model collection with detailed disk usage statistics organized by model type and architecture.

### Example Output

```
2294 files (1.4 TB) → 12 categories

## 🎨 Supported Model Types

> Forge Classic and A1111 are focused on **SD1 and SDXL** checkpoints. The organization system can still categorize any model type found in your collection, but only SD and SDXL families can be used for generation.

| Category | Detection patterns | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| **SD** | SD 1, SD1, SD 2, SD2 | SD 1.x and SD 2.x |
| **SDXL** | SDXL | Base SDXL |
| **Pony** | PONY | Pony V6 and variants (SDXL-based) |
| **Illustrious** | ILLUSTRIOUS | Illustrious XL (SDXL-based) |
| **NoobAI** | NOOBAI, NOOB AI, NAI | NoobAI v-pred (SDXL-based) |
| **Other** | (unrecognized) | Configurable |

### Custom Categories

You can define your own categories in **Settings** → **Model Organization** using JSON format:

```json
{
  "SD": ["SD 1", "SD1", "SD 2", "SD2"],
  "SDXL": ["SDXL"],
  "MyCustomType": ["CUSTOM", "PATTERN"]
}
```

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues

- Some models may not have `baseModel` metadata (download from CivitAI to get it)
- Dashboard shows "Unorganized" for files placed directly in root model folders
- Rollback only works for the last operation
- Maximum 5 backups are kept (older ones are deleted)
- Queue restore banner: after a browser disconnect, click the banner manually to restore your queue; the feature is fully functional

## 💡 Tips

- **First time using?** Update model info & tags to generate `.json` files with metadata
- **Want to see your collection?** Use Dashboard tab to analyze disk usage
- **Want custom folders?** Edit JSON in Settings → Model Organization
- **Made a mistake?** Use "Undo Organization" button immediately
- **Need help?** Check console logs (`[CivitAI Browser Ex]` prefix)
